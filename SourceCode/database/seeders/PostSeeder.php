         Children are naturally drawn to them, and this makes horses a desirable alternative to watching TV, browsing the Internet, or just "hanging out". Horse riding also puts children in touch with nature, and can be enjoyed alone or in groups.

        When the whole family is involved, the time spent with the horses can strengthen the bonds between family members and become material for cherished childhood memories. Furthermore, the benefits of sharing horses are lasting, as a childs horse habit can develop into a rewarding, lifelong hobby.

        If your child loves animals and you are concerned about that child’s problem solving, goal setting, or decision-making skills, then you should definitely involve him or her in the horses.',

                If your child is going to take horseback riding lessons, then they are going to need certain clothing and safety equipment. Whether your child is participating in an English private horseback riding lesson, or a Western group horse riding lesson, safety equipment is of the utmost importance. In this article, you will learn what your child needs to be safe around horses and ponies.

                The basic safety equipment needed includes boots, a helmet and riding pants. These can be purchased at a local tack store or online.

                Horse Riding Boot Needs

                You should always wear a good protective horseback riding boot whenever you are around horses. It doesnt matter if you are planning to ride or simply plan on a grooming session. Boots are important while you are on the ground to protect you in case a horse accidentally steps on your foot. They are also important while riding, because they have a heel that keeps your foot from slipping too far into the stirrup causing you to get stuck. It is obvious that you dont want your foot to be stuck, if you were to experience a fall from a horse. So dont cut corners where an equestrian boot is concerned.

                Paddock boots are typically the type of boot used for English horseback riding lessons. A paddock boot is a leather ankle boot that can either lace up or zip closed. These can also be used for Western riding, or a cowboys boots can be used. In English riding, tall boots that go up to your knees are not required for lessons and usually children do not start wearing them until they are over the age of 12 or so.

            Horse Riding Helmet Needs

            A helmet is probably the most important part of your childs equestrian wardrobe, because it protects the skull and brain. While a helmet should always be worn while riding, it can also be worn while on the ground as an extra safety precaution while being around horses. A schooling helmet is typically used for riding lessons. As the name implies, schooling helmets are only used for practice, not for horse shows. I personally like the adjustable kind. They have a little dial in the back that you can adjust to fit your head perfectly, so it doesnt fall down onto your forehead while you are riding.

            Horse Riding Pant Needs

            Long pants should be worn when riding horses. This is to protect the legs from rubbing against the saddle and horse. It can also protect the legs should your child fall from her horse or pony. If your child is taking English riding lessons, schooling tights or schooling breeches are usually worn. For Western riding, regular blue jeans are typically worn.

            Once your child has been around horses for a while, their comfort grows, and there might be a tendency to cut corners. Dont allow your child to get too comfortable. You must always remind them to follow the safety rules, however much at ease they become around horses.',

You will learn to understand [horse talk] better as you progress, but keep your eyes open and be aware of your horse, other horses around you, and the surroundings.

                Horseback riding is a great pastime. Not only can the rider get out in nature and spend time with an amazing animal, but there are also health benefits associated with riding.

                Horseback riding can improve the rider’s core strength, it increases muscle tone and flexibility, and it improves coordination.

                You will also find that bringing the horse to and from the stable strengthens the muscles and increases cardiovascular capacity.

                Riding a horse isn’t something that a person will instinctively know how to do. Before riding, the individual will need to know how to ride a horse step by step.',

        Learning how to ride safely in a group is an important skill that riders need if they want to try riding at horse shows or go on tours.

        Sometimes riders who ride private lessons are at a disadvantage because they are not used to riding and being aware of what is going on around them. Trotting and tossing in a ring alone is very different than doing it in a group of jockeys. Group lessons are a good practice for this.',

                Please make sure the clothes do not have any loose ends or pieces hanging down or around. Be aware of having anything loose hanging that could be caught suddenly on something.

                This could be very dangerous, as the rider could be pulled from the horse very abruptly, causing major body injuries  to the rider.

                The heel will keep the foot from coming out of the stirrups. Finally, the rider should wear a helmet. I have written several post on this site about about how important I feel wearing a safety cowboy helmet is.

            When getting on the horse, the rider should hold the reins in their left hand or hold onto the rounded knob on the saddle which is called the pommel.

        Equestrian jumping is a combination of dance and gymnastics on the back of a moving horse.

        Horse jumping is a unique sport that helps develop jumping

        The ability to ride frequently
        Since group lessons are less expensive than private lessons, this may give you the opportunity to ride more often. If you sign up for group lessons, you may be able to ride twice a week instead of just once. Or perhaps, it will allow you to save money to rent a horse in the future.

        Private lessons are always an option
        If youve tried group lessons and it seems intimidating to you, private lessons can always be an option. Maybe take a private class once a month to work on something youve been stuck with. Perhaps take a private retouching lesson before the show. Nothing should be set on stone.

        A combination of group and private lessons works well for many riders. For example, dressage lessons are best in private because they are very technical. Jump lessons are easily taught in groups and provide plenty of opportunities to watch others jump in their courses and learn by watching.',

                If the rider wants the horse to speed up to a trot, they should gently squeeze the horse’s side with the inside of their legs.

                In some cases, a gentle kick with the heel will be necessary. To increase the speed, the rider should put more pressure on the horse’s side.
